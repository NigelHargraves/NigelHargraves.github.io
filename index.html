                            I have recently completed the JAMStack Bootcamp, on this course I have been learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and responsive design principles. Also I have been learning to solve problems with JavaScript and explore the tools and frameworks which
                            I've used to try and master the skills of modern development. I am hoping to move to the next level in coding to launch a new career, even though the course has finished I am still learning and I'm looking forward to entering
                            the industry. There are some links at the top of the page to some of my work.
